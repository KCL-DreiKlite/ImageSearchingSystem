# Welcome
Hello! Welcome to my page of Image Searching System(ISS)!

The reason I start this project is to find a way to sort and classify my image library, since there's thousands of images in that folder.

This is my first time to start mid-project by my own. Hope this project can keep updating.

## Goal
The goal of Image Searching System(ISS) is to provides these features:

* A Core that provides some basic methods such as Folder Initialization, Create JSONs Files, Transform 
* A Tag System that you can edit and control the tags.
* A Image System that you can append or deleate tags onto each image.
* A well looking and useful GUI that served the features above properly.

# Version Information

* Add core.ISSCore.formatFileLength(File) which done the same thing as formatFileLength(Long) but the input argument is File.
